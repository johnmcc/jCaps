Hi, my name's Dr Archimedes Einstein and I'm a Doctor of Science at the University of Science

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:9,000
in a very famous town that you're too stupid to have heard of.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Anyway, today we're going to talk about "synergies".

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A lot of people are worried about synergies, but I can tell you that

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
statistics show

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
there is no danger of increased cancer risk from synergies.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
However, it's better to be safe than sorry.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to demonstrate how you how we can leverage a synergy.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
First of all, I've got this banana

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
This banana represents "Web 2.0" and look,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've written on it some "user-generated content"

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
just to prove the point [LOL, WTF, You suck]

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I take my "Web 2.0" and I put it in an envelope

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
marked "paradigm shift".

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
OK. Very important, I put the envelope down and

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:46,000
With a bit of "blue sky thinking"

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,000
I "push the envelope"

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then, I take my leverage mallet, and

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,000
URGH!

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
RGRRRRRARGRGGH!!

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
EURGGGARRRRGGGRRGARGGAHAARRAGGHGRRAGAHAARGH!!!!

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
...and there we can see a synergy, leveraged.
